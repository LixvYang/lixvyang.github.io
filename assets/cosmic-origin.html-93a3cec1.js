During its billion years of helium nuclear fusion, it continuously emitted various particles around itself.

When it reaches one million degrees Celsius, the electromagnetic force of the nucleus will not be able to stop the high-speed running atomic nuclei from each other. The power of collision.

These &quot;light particles&quot;, or light quanta, move from the center of the sun to the surface. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second, and the radius of the sun is 700,000 kilometers. Therefore, if the light quantum walks in a straight line, it only takes <strong>2 seconds</strong> to reach the surface from the center.</p><p>But this is definitely not the case. As the light quanta advances outward, they will collide with countless atoms and electrons inside the sun.

Various purines and pyrimidines can be arranged and combined into RNA molecules, but it does not violate the agreement. Patiently observe this own cell, blue, a light blue blue dot, relying on the residual heat emitted by the central star, and its location is exactly the necessary place for the cradle of life-water.</p><p>The location of this dim blue dot is so cute, there are three forms of water, and water happens to be the cradle of life, oh my God, it doesn’t know what will happen, it knows that one day it will fall apart, like I don&#39;t know where I came from, and I don&#39;t know where I am going to lead.</p><p>Perhaps we should be grateful to this universe for creating a unique living environment for us, and giving us an environment full of unknowns. Everything that seems beautiful is like poppies-the surface is bright and beautiful, but in fact, the undercurrent is surging.</p><p>Occasionally, a comet slammed into this dark blue spot, bringing life primitive matter and organic matter to this primitive planet, and even sowed the seeds of life.</p><p>Slowly, the water in this cell gradually increased, completely turning into a water-filled planet. Waiting and waiting silently, finally one day, a magical thing happened. This is a process full of randomness and uncertainty. Various amino acids make up proteins, and they happen to combine with other substances to become a passable Life evolved from the environment. In the process of forming life, these substances automatically condense to form aggregates. This feature of automatically gathering surrounding materials, once formed into life, will also absorb surrounding materials, remove waste, and improve oneself.</p><p>The cold second law of thermodynamics says that all isolated systems evolve in the direction of entropy increase. But the magic of life evolution is that it can exchange matter and energy with the environment, creating negative entropy for itself, so as to maintain itself strong and tough, and maintain upward vitality.</p><p>The second law of thermodynamics began a scene of rebellion, and was born as a face that continued to cause negative entropy to survive. This gadget continuously increases entropy to the environment to maintain its continuous vitality. Life actually started with this, and opened a new prologue.</p><p>Slowly, this dim blue dot began to produce new things, and the species slowly increased, as if a virus was produced in its own cells.

They can not only produce all the elements, but also because the larger the star, the shorter the life span, and therefore the cycle is also short.</p><p>Therefore, Stellar&#39;s Big Mac is the most efficient factory for manufacturing elements in the universe. However, the mass limit of the largest star in the universe is one hundred suns. If it is larger, it will disintegrate due to its own nuclear reaction too violently.</p><p>Gravity creates elements, but it also binds elements. Small stars can produce about ten kinds of elements, but these elements cannot flow in the universe in the end.</p><p>Large stars can produce more elements. Generally, stars that are more than 8 times the mass of the sun can make fusion unparalleled. The high temperature of its core reaches billions of degrees to continuously create incredible fusion, and the energy produced by each fusion makes the star. Expand more. So it is like an onion to form an amazing multi-layer nuclear fusion space, this space can reach 10 billion kilometers, containing the entire solar system.</p><p>As the fusion progresses, stars become more and more dangerous. Because the heavier the element, the less energy provided by fusion, and the huge star must be supported by the continuous release of nuclear energy. However, when the fusion reaches the 26th iron element, the crumbling star suffers the most lethal damage—— Because the structure of iron is extremely stable, it does not release energy during fusion.</p><p>As a result, the huge and expanding star will collapse because the core loses support.</p><p>Therefore, the smashing explosion of stars, the hurricane of energy sweeping the heavens, this is the supernova explosion.
